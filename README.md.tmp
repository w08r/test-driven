# Test-driven Coffee Architecture

The coffee making domain consists of the core domain (making coffee),
a supporting subdomain (coffee delivery) and generic subdomains (auth,
purchasing).

The project is implemented as 4 bounded contexts

- [HotDrinkMaker](./HOTDRINKMAKER.md)
- [HotDrinkDelivery](./HOTDRINKDELIVERY.md)
- [IAM](./IAM.md)
- [Purchasing](./PURCHASING.md)

The context map below describes the relationship between these contexts.
